#
# push-to-pantheon.sh
#
# This script will push all of the generated build results created on a
# CI server such as Travis or Circle to a Drupal site hosted on Pantheon.
#
# This script may be called on the CI server, or locally. On the CI server,
# environment variables are used to authenticate with Pantheon.  When used
# locally, the script assumes that the user has already authenticated with
# terminus before calling this script. The environment variables may also
# be used locally, of course, but this is generally less convenient.
#
# This script will look for and parse a behat-pantheon.yml file to determine
# which Pantheon site to copy to.
#
# The specific environment variables we need are:
#
#   SITE_NAME:     The human-readable name of the site to give to site-install.
#                  Optional. Defaults to $PSITE.
#   PEMAIL:        The email address to log on to Pantheon with.
#                  Optional. Alternately, use `terminus auth login` first.
#   PPASS:         The password to log on to Pantheon with.
#                  Optional. Alternately, use `terminus auth login` first.
#   SITEPASS:      The password that should be set on the test site.
#                  Optional. Defaults to a random string (use `drush uli`).
#   CI_BOT_EMAIL:  The email address to use in the git commit attribution
#   CI_BOT_NAME:   The name to use in the git commit attribution
#   DRUSH_VERSION: The version of Drush to use on Pantheon.
#                  Optional. Defaults to Drush 8.
#
# It is also expected that there should be an SSH private key in
# $HOME/.ssh that can be used to push code to the Pantheon git repository.
